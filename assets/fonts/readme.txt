Hey there font fans. Meet Reisenberg. This display font features uppercase characters in two different styles: one is fairly traditional while the lowercase letters have varied angled horizontal bars and arms. While the two can be combined kerning is only available on same case pairs. The broad nature
of Reisenberg will quickly gobble up horizontal space on your next project and deliver a clean, strong look. The tightly spaced feel will look right at home on a poster, book cover, or logo. Next time go with Reisenberg and say it with some emphasis! Basic latin, extended latin, European accents,
punctuation, and kerning is included. Additional characters, marks, and other languages, may be added for a fee. There are a few alternate glyphs included (B, E, F, P, R, and S) that provide a more futuristic look.

This font like my others are free for personal use only as long as this readme file stays intact. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user license agreement. You can also visit www.sharkshock.net/license for more info. I also design custom fonts for
